Utilizes OpenCV for capturing real-time gestures and facial expressions via webcam or video streams.
Processes images and videos in real time for quick and precise predictions.
2. High Predictive Accuracy
Achieves 95% accuracy by leveraging deep learning models developed and trained with TensorFlow.
Ensures robustness across various lighting conditions, angles, and individual differences.
3. Enhanced User Experience
Web Browser Integration: Provides a seamless and interactive user experience by integrating with web browser features, enabling extended functionalities.
4. Emergency Alerts
Automated email notification system triggered in emergencies.
Sends detailed alert messages with contextual data for swift responses.
Technical Stack
Programming Language
Python: Core language for implementing logic and integrating components.
Libraries and Frameworks
OpenCV
Used for real-time image and video processing.
Facilitates feature extraction for gesture and facial recognition.
TensorFlow
Develops and trains deep learning models for classification and prediction.
Optimized for high accuracy and performance.
Matplotlib
Visualizes and analyzes training and prediction data.
Provides clear insights into the model's performance.
System Architecture
1. Input Processing
Captures video feed through the webcam using OpenCV.
Frames are processed and passed to the recognition model.
2. Model Prediction
TensorFlow deep learning models analyze gestures and facial expressions.
The system classifies the detected features with 95% accuracy.
3. Emergency Notification
If a predefined condition is met (e.g., distress signal or gesture), the system triggers the email notification system.
Automated emails are sent with pre-configured details for rapid response.
4. Web Browser Integration
User-friendly interface for interaction with browser features.
Smooth integration to extend the usability of the recognition system.
